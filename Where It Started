# Where It All Started

I was standing in front of the Command office with the rest of the troops, weekend warriors they called us, but we form the backbone of the nation's reserve force, ready to deploy when called upon. 
Today was no ordinary day for the Command, some of the troops will have their contributions recognized in the form of military awards and so will some civilian volunteers who had contributed their time and talent to the success of the given "missions".
Standing in formation, we waited for the guests to arrive and for the field ceremony to begin. Then from out of nowhere I saw her.. wearing a bright red shirt and pony tails, walking all pretty but oblivious to the stares she was getting, with confident strides but seemingly unaware of her true worth.
Even then, something inside me said I was in trouble. I felt inexplicably drawn to her, my eyes just won't leave her and I felt something familiar about her, and a feeling like I just found something I've lost that was so precious to me.
After the welcome ceremony on the field, we transferred to the auditorium for the official awarding of the plaques of recognition. It was there that I had the chance to meet her. And in her owns words after a year later, she describes to me how she saw my reaction to her. "I saw you looking at me (before we were introduced) when they called my name to accept the award of recognition, you were seated in the middle aisle and you were looking at me while smiling funny. I thought it was weird at the time but still, I also felt a familiar comfort to it, your smile".
